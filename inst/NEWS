Version 1.8.0
-------------

Features:
    + The Python implementation of profile creation has been deprecated
    + SNV profiles are now stored as data frames, rather than GRanges objects
    + The `create_profile` function now now reads profiles into memory, instead
      of storing them on disk. De-duplication and removal of mitochondrial
      variants is now also performed at this stage
    + The `create_profiles` function now returns a list of data frames
    + A new function, `write_profile`, can write profiles to disk
    + The `read_profile` function now reads profiles without performing any
      de-duplication or removing mitochondrial chromosomes
    + The `compare_profiles`, `compare_many` and `list_variants` functions now
      converts input profiles to GRanges internally
    + Keep the FILTER column in created SNV profiles
    + Add a check for the creation of zero-variant profiles
    + Add a check for the existance of the specified input samples
    + Removal of non-standard chromosomes and variant de-duplication is now
      optional, and filtration documentation has been extended

Version 1.6.0
-------------

Features:
    + Make the variant caller-specific filtering optional (on by default) and
      rename the relevant parameter names for increased clarity
    + Add a check to look for gVCF files as input, including the existance of
      <NON_REF> alleles (common for gVCF files)
    + Add checks to see if input VCFs correctly contain DP, AD and GT data

Version 1.4.0
-------------

Features:
    + Add convenience functions for creating and reading multiple SNV profiles
    + Add functionality for reading general COSMIC mutational data, not just
      cell line mutational data

Fixes:
    + Fix an issue when reading COSMIC data due to new GRanges functionality

Miscellaneous:
    + Update the citation info with the now-published seqCAT-specific article


VERSION 1.2.0
-------------

Features:
    + Add functionality for analysing VCF files containing unannotated variants
    + Add functionality for listing non-overlapping variants between profiles
    + Mitochondrial variants can now be optionally skipped when reading SNV
      profiles in the `read_variants` function
    + Add the `list_variants` function for listing the genotypes of
      user-specified variants in each provided SNV profile
    + Add the `plot_variant_list` function for plotting a genotype grid for
      each variant output by the `list_variants` function

Fixes:
    + Fix a multi-sample VCF profile creation issue (python only)
    + Reading zero-variant profiles now properly returns a GRanges object with
      a dummy-variant profile containing the sample name
    + Enable the `plot_impacts` function to properly analyse multi-impact SNVs
    + Fix reading of SNV profiles containing single-quoted strings

VERSION 1.0.0
-------------

Features:
    + Create single nucleotide variant (SNV) profiles from RNA/DNA-seq samples
    + Characterise the biological equivalency and difference between samples
    + Evaluate putative impacts of SNVs differing between samples
    + Investigate and validate known variants and specific genomic regions
    + Authenticate cell lines with a known SNV profile or the COSMIC database
