Version 1.8.0
-------------

This is a release with major changes to seqCAT's functionality and how it
can be used. Several changes to how SNV profiles are created, manipulated and
stored are introduced, along with some changes to what data objects are used
internally versus at the user-level. The reason for these changes is to give
the user a more consistent and optimised workflow where the same objects (data
frames) are manipulated in all steps, all within R.

MAJOR FEATURES:

    o The Python implementation of profile creation has been deprecated
    o SNV profiles are now stored as data frames, rather than GRanges objects
    o The `create_profile` function now now reads profiles into memory, instead
      of storing them on disk. De-duplication and removal of mitochondrial
      variants is now also performed at this stage
    o The `create_profiles` function now returns a list of data frames
    o A new function, `write_profile`, can write profiles to disk
    o The `read_profile` function now reads profiles without performing any
      de-duplication or removing mitochondrial chromosomes
    o The `compare_profiles`, `compare_many` and `list_variants` functions now
      converts input profiles to GRanges internally

MINOR FEATURES:
    o Keep the FILTER column in created SNV profiles
    o Add a check for creation zero-variant profiles
    o Add a check for input sample existance in VCF files

Version 1.6.0
-------------

FEATURES:

    o Make the variant caller-specific filtering optional (on by default) and
      rename the relevant parameter names for increased clarity
    o Add a check to look for gVCF files as input, including the existance of
      <NON_REF> alleles (common for gVCF files)
    o Add checks to see if input VCFs correctly contain DP, AD and GT data

Version 1.4.0
-------------

FEATURES:

    o Add convenience functions for creating and reading multiple SNV profiles
    o Add functionality for reading general COSMIC mutational data, not just
      cell line mutational data

FIXES:

    o Fix an issue when reading COSMIC data due to new GRanges functionality

MISCELLANEOUS: 

    o Update the citation info with the now-published seqCAT-specific article


VERSION 1.2.0
-------------

FEATURES:

    o Add functionality for analysing VCF files containing unannotated variants
    o Add functionality for listing non-overlapping variants between profiles
    o Mitochondrial variants can now be optionally skipped when reading SNV
      profiles in the `read_variants` function
    o Add the `list_variants` function for listing the genotypes of
      user-specified variants in each provided SNV profile
    o Add the `plot_variant_list` function for plotting a genotype grid for
      each variant output by the `list_variants` function

FIXES:

    o Fix a multi-sample VCF profile creation issue (python only)
    o Reading zero-variant profiles now properly returns a GRanges object with
      a dummy-variant profile containing the sample name
    o Enable the `plot_impacts` function to properly analyse multi-impact SNVs
    o Fix reading of SNV profiles containing single-quoted strings

VERSION 1.0.0
-------------

FEATURES:

    o Create single nucleotide variant (SNV) profiles from RNA/DNA-seq samples
    o Characterise the biological equivalency and difference between samples
    o Evaluate putative impacts of SNVs differing between samples
    o Investigate and validate known variants and specific genomic regions
    o Authenticate cell lines with a known SNV profile or the COSMIC database
